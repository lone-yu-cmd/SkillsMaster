**Skills Master** is a meta-skill designed to act as a package manager for the AI Skill ecosystem. It allows developers to easily install, update, and manage a library of "Standard Skills" (like `auto-committer`, `code-explainer`, `skill-creator`) across different projects and development environments (Trae, VS Code, Cursor, etc.).

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6+
*   Git

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository** (or copy the `skills-master` directory) into your project's skills directory (e.g., `.skills/` or just `skills/`).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skills-master.git .skills/skills-master
    ```

2.  **Install Standard Skills**:

    You can install specific skills or all available skills using the installation script.

    *   **List available skills**:
        ```bash
        python3 skills/skills-master/scripts/install.py --list
        ```

    *   **Install a specific skill** (e.g., `auto-committer`):
        ```bash
        python3 skills/skills-master/scripts/install.py --name auto-committer
        ```

    *   **Install ALL skills**:
        ```bash
        python3 skills/skills-master/scripts/install.py --all
        ```

## 📖 Usage Guide

Once installed, each skill resides in its own directory (e.g., `skills/auto-committer`) and comes with its own `SKILL.md` documentation.

### Example: Creating a New Skill

Use the **skill-creator** (once installed) to generate a new skill template:

```bash
python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/create_skill.py \
  --name my-custom-skill \
  --description "A custom skill that does amazing things"
```

### Example: Automating Commits

Use the **auto-committer** to handle your git workflow:

```bash
# Analyze changes, update changelog, and commit
python3 skills/auto-committer/scripts/manage_changelog.py add --type feat --message "implement user login"
```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a useful skill you'd like to share with the community, follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create your skill** using `skill-creator`.
3.  **Add it to the master library** using `add-in-skills-master`:
    ```bash
    python3 skills/add-in-skills-master/scripts/add_skill.py --name your-skill-name --description "What it does" --source skills/your-skill-name
    ```
4.  **Submit a Pull Request**.

### Guidelines
*   Keep skills self-contained in their own directory.
*   Include a `SKILL.md` with clear usage instructions.
*   Avoid hardcoded paths (use relative paths).
*   Ensure scripts are cross-platform compatible.
